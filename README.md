Important! As this is a non-commercial project, our server is hosted on a free hosting service, which may cause longer loading times after periods of inactivity.  
If this occurs, please remain connected and avoid closing or reloading the page. Once our backend wakes up, any delays in using our app will be resolved.  
We are actively working to resolve this issue.
